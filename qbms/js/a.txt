we are looping rows and uploading the row one by one

first setting difficulty_level

based on that calculating formatFailCount

then sending program_name and fetching program_id
if found use it otherwise create new program

then sending course_name and fetching course_id
if found use it otherwise create new course

then sending subject_name and fetching subject_id
if found use it otherwise create new subject
 
then inserting questions with all ids

and then options with question_id

new approach

gather unique program, course and subject names and send a get query in db to find their ids

then we will map those ids with names
